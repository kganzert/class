
1)Write a program that asks for your favorite Crayola crayon and
 then takes the string and yells it back in all caps and in reverse.

print "What's your favorite cryon color? "
color_name = gets.chomp
color_name.upcase.reverse
puts color_name.upcase.reverse



2)Write a program that asks for your mood for the day,
then returns the length of the string. Then return the string with 'meow' prepended to it.

print "What's your mood today?"
mood_name = gets.chomp
mood_name.length
puts mood_name.length
puts  "#{mood_name}_meow"

3)Write a program that takes two numbers from the user
 and shows the sum, difference, product and quotient of the two numbers.


puts "Please enter a number"
number_one = gets.chomp.to_i
puts "Please enter another number"
number_two = gets.chomp.to_i
puts "result of product:#{(number_one *number_two)}"
puts "result of sum:#{(number_one + number_two)}"
puts "result of difference:#{(number_one - number_two)}"
puts "result of quotient:#{(number_one / number_two)}"


4)Write a program that asks for a sentence.
Then ask for their favorite word in that sentence.
Then tell them what index that word starts at.
See the Ruby Docs page for String for a handy method to use.

puts "Please write a simple sentence"
number_one = gets.chomp
puts "What is your favorite word in this sentence?"
number_two = gets.chomp
a= ["number_two"]
p a.find_index ('a')
print p

5)Write a program that asks for the cost of your dinner at a restaurant.
The program will return back to you a tip of 18% of your meal cost.
 Make sure the tip is always returned with two decimal places.

 puts "Karen, what is the total amount of your meal today (in numbers only please)?"
 number_one = gets.chomp.to_i
 a = number_one.to_f
 b = (a)*0.18
 puts "The meal cost #{a} dollars plus #{b} dollars in tip. The total comes to #{a+b} dollars."
 

 6)Write a program that accepts your age. Convert your age to how old you are in seconds.
 Convert your age to how old you would be on the 8 different planets
 (hint: search planet rotation conversion rates).
  Output what your age in years would be on each planet.

 puts "Karen, how old are you?"
 a = gets.chomp.to_i
 b = 31536000 # seconds in 365 days
 c = a*b
 mercury = 0.241 * (a)
 venus = 0.61 * (a)
 mars = 1.881 * (a)
 jupiter = 11.86 * (a)
 saturn = 29.46 * (a)
 uranus = 84.01 * (a)
 neptune = 164.8 * (a)
 earth = 1 * (a)

 puts "my age in seconds is #{c}"
 puts "my age on Mercury is #{mercury} years"
 puts "my age on Venus is #{venus} years"
 puts "my age on Mars is #{mars} years"
 puts "my age on Jupiter is #{jupiter} years"
 puts "my age on Saturn is #{saturn} years"
 puts "my age on Uranus is #{uranus} years"
 puts "my age on Neptune is #{neptune} years"
 puts "my age on Earth is #{earth} years"

 
 7)Create a Mad Libs program with at least 10 inputs and a minimum of one each of these:
 verb, plural noun, adjective, preposition, geographical feature, object, number.

 puts "Enter a verb:"
 verb = gets.chomp
 puts "Enter a plural noun:"
 plural_noun = gets.chomp
 puts "Enter an adjective:"
 adjective = gets.chomp
 puts "Enter a celebrity:"
 celebrity = gets.chomp
 puts "Enter a preposition:"
 preposition = gets.chomp
 puts "Enter a location:"
 geographical = gets.chomp
 puts "Enter an object:"
 object = gets.chomp
 puts "Enter a computer language:"
 language = gets.chomp
 puts "Enter a color:"
 color = gets.chomp
 puts "Enter a number:"
 number = gets.chomp.to_i

 puts "#{number} horses #{verb}"
 puts "#{plural_noun} are #{color}"
 puts "#{preposition}"
 puts "#{geographical}"
 puts "I am #{adjective}"
 puts "the #{object} is blue"
 puts "I love #{celebrity} and to learn #{language} too"
